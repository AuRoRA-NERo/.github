# About Aurora
AuRoRA platform is a real-time mobile robot simulation and experimentation framework, hosted on MATLABÂ®.

The tool is structured according to the software-in-the-loop (SIL) paradigm, in which all components (sensors, actuators, kinematic and
dynamic UAV modeling, control, etc.) are simulated using descriptive mathematical.
